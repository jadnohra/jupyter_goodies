# jupyter_goodies
A collection of Jupyter notebook goodies I wrote.

## pinhole.ipynb
[pinhole.ipynb](pinhole.ipynb) uses a pinhole camera model to software-render models from .obj files. It processes the model vertices to center the model nicely in view. The derivation of what went into the code is [here](screen/pinhole_deriv.jpg).
